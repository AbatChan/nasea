# NASEA Web

Welcome to **NASEA** - Natural-Language Autonomous Software-Engineering Agent

## What I can do

- **Create** full projects from natural language descriptions
- **Edit** existing code with simple instructions
- **Debug** issues and fix errors
- **Search** the web for up-to-date information

## Examples

Try asking me:
- "Create a snake game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"
- "Build a todo app with dark mode"
- "Make a weather dashboard that shows current conditions"

## Getting Started

Just type what you want to build and I'll handle the rest!
